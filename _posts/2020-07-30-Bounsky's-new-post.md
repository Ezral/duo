Hi! Welcome to my new blog!

To set up, clone the repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Ezral/duo.git
```

To start everything, simply do:
```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Once you've made all the necessary adjustment locally, change your git repo's ```origin``` before pushing:
```
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

After that, commit and push the changes that you've made and let github render your blog for you.

Happy blogging!
